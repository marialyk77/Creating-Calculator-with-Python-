üòÜ I am so excited and I definitely cannot hide it!!!!!

üíï The reason is simple: I keep going on with my training in Data Analytics and here I present my first project with Python!
  
üíæ This training is part of the course: Python Programming for Beginners from the online learning platform by Alex Freberg: https://www.analystbuilder.com/ 

üèß The goal of this excericse is to build a basic calculator. 

Course of action: 
  
    Function Definitions:

          Defined separate functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) for each arithmetic operation to improve code modularity.

    Utilized print statements to display options that enhance the overall user experience.
          
          A for Addition, S for Subtraction, M for Multiplication, D for Division. 
     
     User Input Validation:

          Implemented input validation to ensure the user's choice is valid before proceeding with calculations.

     Calculator Operations:

          We created a calculator program allowing users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

     Looping Structure:

          Implemented a while True loop for multiple calculations, breaking when the user chooses not to perform another calculation.    

     Program Termination:

          Implemented an interactive loop that allows users to decide whether to perform another calculation. 
          After each calculation, users are prompted with a clear message ("Do you want to do another calculation?") and can input "yes" to continue or "no" to exit the program. 
          The loop breaks when the user chooses not to perform another calculation. 

‚ô•Ô∏è Grateful to Alex for creating an insightful Python programming course. His online lessons and platform have been instrumental in my learning journey.
